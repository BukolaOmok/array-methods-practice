# ideas:

order examples by:

-   ease of use,
-   then usefulness

group if possible by type of function argument (e.g. predicate)

### find

find first string over len 6
find first odd number in array of numbers

### findLast

find the last string over len 6

### filter

find all strings over len 6

find all objects whose first or second name is longer than 6

find all odd numbers

find only the strings in an array of strings and numbers

### every

find out if it is true that all strings are longer than length 6
find out if it is true that all elements of an array are string type

### forEach

forEach is out of place here - the rest take predicate functions

for each string, blah
for each object, blah

-   display banner

---

### cross-product with these element data types:

objects, nested arrays, strings, numbers
